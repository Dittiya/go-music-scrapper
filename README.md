# go-music-scrapper
Get music with as little relation as possible to the majority of the playlist but not too far so the result is still "related".

# TODO
- Get User's profile and playlist
- Will probably use PCA or another unsupervised learning.

# Reminders
In spotify's developer dashboard:
- Whitelist users in Development mode
- Add Redirect URIs (type the whole uri e.g. if running local type http://localhost:8080/callback)
